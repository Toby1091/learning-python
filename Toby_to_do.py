# TODO:
# compute total # of speeches speech_analysis (cb_count_dict) & compare with #speeches in speeches_metadata (json)
# 
# Task 2:
# speech_analysis.py: print cb_count_dict sorted by bank with most speeches (at the top): Example
# Bank 1: 300
# Bank 2: 125
# Bank 3: 34

# Task 3: Move code into function

# Task 4:
# speech_analysis.py: Take ouput of task 2 and align number of speeches
# Bank 1: 300
# Bank 2: 125
# Bank 3:  55
# Bank 4:   3

# Task 5:
# Calculate average and median of number of speeches

# Task 6:
# Compute weights of individual CBs
